Digital Library using Elasticsearch and OpenAI Chatbot:

Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an innovative digital library platform to improve the discovery and
understanding of Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). The system we envision will include a
powerful search engine to efficiently locate relevant ETDs from the provided dataset, leveraging
techniques such as Elasticsearch indexing. Upon selecting an item, users will view a detailed summary
page presenting key metadata as well as an abstract.
A unique feature we plan to incorporate is an AI-powered conversational agent on each summary page.
This chatbot will be customized to address user questions specifically related to the content of that
particular ETD. For privacy reasons, the record of these conversations will be automatically erased when
users navigate away.
The user interface will offer additional key functions like user accounts, authentication, spell correction,
search auto-complete, lists, ratings, feedback forms, and ETD downloads. The project timeline outlines
building these components out in phases, working up to a polished platform that makes discovering and
learning from academic works in the form of ETDs an intuitive process.
With structured data handling and reusable preprocessing code provided upfront, we are well-positioned
to deliver an engaging portal for accessing ETD metadata and full-texts within this robust digital library
ecosystem.
